Private types 

Private type stand between abstract type and concrete types. You can
coerce your private type back to the concrete type (zero-performance),
but backward is \textbf{not allowed}.

For ordinary private type, you can still do pattern match, print the
result in toplevel, and debugger. A big advantage for private type
abbreviation is that for parameterized type(like container) coercion,
you can still do the coercion pretty fast(optimization), and some
parameterized types(not containers) can still do such coercions while
abstract types can not do. Since ocaml does not provide ad-hoc
polymorphism, or type functions like Haskell, this is pretty
straight-forward.
