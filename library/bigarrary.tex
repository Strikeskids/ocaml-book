\section{bigarray}
\label{sec:bigarray}

This implementation allows efficient sharing of large numerical arrays
between Caml code and C or Fortran numerical libraries. Your are
encouraged to \verb|open Bigarray|. Big arrays support the
ad-hoc polymorphic operations (comparison, hashing,marshall)

Element kinds

The abstract type \verb|type ('a,'b) kind| captures type 'a for
values read or written in the array, while 'b which represents the
actual content of the big array.
