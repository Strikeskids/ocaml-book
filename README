It's a book about programming ocaml productively.

There is a pdf version here
http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hongboz/hongbo_zhang_files/temp.pdf

Considering the topic is too big. I may exclude some chapters to
refine only some chapters first.

You can take a look at master.tex to see I have commented some
chapters, and uncomment them for fun.
