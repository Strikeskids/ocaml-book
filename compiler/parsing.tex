\section{Parsing}

\subsection{Parsetree}

module Parsetree defines Abstract syntax tree produced by parsing.

In \textit{parsing} directory, \textit{parser.mly} defines BNF of oaml.
module Parse is a wrapper of \textit{parsing},
\textit{parsetree.mli}(used by ocamlyacc) defines the \textit{ast}
type. \textit{printast.ml} defines the pretty printer for ocaml
ast. However, the printer here is mainly for debugging purpose, its
output is invalid ocaml code.

It's easy to play with parsing api.

\begin{ocamlcode}
  Parse.implementation (Lexing.from_string "let a =  M.(b + 3) ");;
\end{ocamlcode}
You can also set \textit{Clflags.dump\_parsetree} in the toplevel.
