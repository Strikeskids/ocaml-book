\section{Interesting Notes}

Ocsigen can load the code dynamically (both bytecode and native code)
without having to restart the application (in fact, this is the
default: static linking is a recent addition). You can use omake -P to
have OMake monitor the filesystem and rebuild as you edit, in the
background. Also, with a rule to the tell ocsigen to reload your
application code (via the command FIFO), you can be running the new
code the second you save it.
