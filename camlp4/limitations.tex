\section{Limitations}

Camlp4 is a source-to-source program transformation tool, so you must
have the \verb|source code | to do meta programming, which means, that
you can not do \verb|reflection| in the module level, so far. This may
brings some inconvenience from time to time, e.g, sometimes you don't
get the definition of some types.
