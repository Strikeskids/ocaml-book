\subsection{Simple Building Experiment}

Without \verb|ocamlbuild|, \verb|ocamlfind|, a simple build would be
like this

\begin{bashcode}
ocamlc -pp camlp4o.opt error.ml
\end{bashcode}  

This way is not recommended to play with \textit{camlp4}, rolling a
robust \textit{myocamlbuild}(\ref{myocamlbuild}) is the right way to
use camlp4, otherwise you may be frustrated with the complex building
process.
