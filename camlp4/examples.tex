Notice that here for \verb|pa_list.cmo|, we did not need to link
\verb|batteries|, since at executation time, it did not bother
\verb|Batteries| at all. Read the commented output, you see at this
phase, that \verb|Nil| was acutally translated into \verb|"Nil"|. So
actually you don't bother Batteries at all. Even you said
\verb|open Batteries|, ocaml compiler was not that stupid to link it.


The test file is also interesting.
