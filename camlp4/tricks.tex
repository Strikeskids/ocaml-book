Predefined Parsers


\verb|-parser macro (* pa_macro.cmo*)| 



There is a ``macro'' syntax extension that is distributed with Camlp4,
and can do basic cpp-like stuff, including __FILE__ and a __LOCATION__
macros.

For example, the following content, named test.ml:
\begin{ocamlcode}
  let test =
    __LOCATION__
\end{ocamlcode}


When processed through 'camlp4o pa_macro.cmo', will result in:


\begin{ocamlcode}
  let test = Loc.of_tuple (``test.ml'', 2, 13, 17, 2, 13, 29, false)
\end{ocamlcode}


(To compile:  ocamlc -pp 'camlp4o pa_macro.cmo' ...)

The ``Loc.of_tuple'' call is a reference to a function implemented in
Camlp4 Loc module; if you make you project depend (at runtime, not
camlp4-time) on Camlp4 loc-handling libraries, you'll get functions to
manipulate the location and its information. You can also define your
own Loc module in test.ml:
\begin{ocamlcode}
  module Loc = struct
    let of_tuple
      ((file_name, start_line, start_bol, start_off, stop_line,
stop_bol, stop_off, is_ghost) as loc) =
        loc
  end

  let test =
    __LOCATION__
\end{ocamlcode}

This way can reduce the dependency on \verb|Camlp4| and even \verb|Dynlink|
